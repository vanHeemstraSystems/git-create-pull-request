# 700 - Tips and Tricks

- **Use Descriptive Branch Names**: Use meaningful branch names that describe the feature or bug youâ€™re working on (e.g., ```feature/user-authentication```, ```bugfix/login-error```).

- **Detailed Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages to explain the changes. This helps reviewers understand your changes better.

- **Review Changes Locally**: Before pushing, use ```git diff``` to review your changes and ensure they are as expected.

- **Update Your Branch**: Keep your branch up to date with the base branch to avoid merge conflicts. Use ```git fetch``` and ```git rebase``` or ```git merge```.
